1. Introduction

    The goal of this project is to recreate the classic R-Type game (1987)
    and add a multiplayer feature to it.
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
    "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
    be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2. R-Type Architecture

    The Architecture is a basic client-server game architecture. All the game engine
    is in the server. When a client connects to the server, it uses the TCP protocol.
    If it connects successfully, the client has the choice between creating a lobby
    or joining an existing lobby. A maximum of 4 clients can connect to the server
    at the same time. When the lobby’s admin wants, he can launch the game at any
    moment. The server can run several games at the same time.

3. R-Type TCP Protocol

    All the communications before the game’s launch are done using the following
    R-Type Protocol.

    3a. Payload

        Every transmission done with the R-Type Protocol MUST transmit a payload
        with the following protocol :

        A TCP Request has a Request data structure has a header containing all
        the metadata of the request (magicCode and requestCode) and the body of
        the request.

        There are 3 types of TCP body :

            - OnlyUsernameBody
            - LobbyRequest
            - ListPlayerRequest

        The data structure Request is copied into the socket via the memcpy()
        function which allows the receiver to access the data structure simply
        and process it.

    3b. TCP Codes

        These are the following code we used to allow the client and the server
        to communicate with each other. These codes are separated into 3 different
        categories :

            Action codes :

                100: Create Connection
                101: Create lobby
                102: List player
                103: Join a game
                104: Ready signal
                105: Start signal
                106: Someone Join Lobby

            Success codes:

                200: Successful connection
                201: Successful lobby creation
                202: Successful listing
                203: Successful joining
                204: Successful ready signal
                205: Successful start
                206: Successful someone join lobby

            Failure codes :

                400: Failed connection
                401: Failed lobby creation
                402: Failed listing
                403: Failed joining
                404: Failed ready signal
                405: Failed start
                406: Failed someone join lobby

4. R-Type UDP Protocol

    All the communications during the game are done using the following R-Type
    Protocol.

    4a. Payload

        Every transmission done with the R-Type Protocol MUST transmit a payload
        with the following protocol :

        An UDP Request has a Request data structure has a header containing all
        the metadata of the request (magicCode and requestCode) and the body of
        the request.

        There are 4 types of UDP body :

            - PlayerUpdate
            - EnemyUpdate
            - AmmoUpdate
            - ObjectUpdate

        The data structure Request is copied into the socket via the memcpy()
        function which allows the receiver to access the data structure simply
        and process it.

    4b. UDP Codes

        Action codes :

            110: Send ping
            111: Send player update
            112: Send enemy update
            113: Send ammo update
            114: Send object update

        Success Codes :

            210: Successful ping
            211: Successful player update
            212: Successful enemy update
            213: Successful ammo update
            214: Successful object update
